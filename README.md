# NeuralNetwork
This was a neural network that was created from scratch.  The only dependencies are the two python libraries, numpy and random.  The book, Neural Networks and Deep Learning, by Michael Nielsen (http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) was an invaluable resource in creating this project.
